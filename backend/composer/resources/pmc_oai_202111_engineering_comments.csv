Labeling was limited to the ipsilateral side of the injection, even though we observed rare cases of bilateral labeling, likely due to accidental injection into the adjacent and merged left iBAT section.

589,0,"The lacrimal gland is supplied by parasympathetic innervation via the facial nerve (CN VII). Preganglionic fibers originate in the lacrimal nucleus in the pons (a portion of the superior salivatory nucleus), synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, and then travel with the lacrimal nerve, the smallest branch of CN V1. In contrast, sympathetic innervation of the lacrimal gland is similar to the salivary glands in that postganglionic fibers originate from the superior cervical ganglion. These fibers travel along the internal carotid artery plexus to the pterygopalatine ganglion, where they join with parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland [18].",Maryann Martone,2066,2023-05-09 08:38:20,pmc_oai_202111
